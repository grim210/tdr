    main and renderer subcomponents.

Main
----
Sample 02 - Checks to see that we're able to load JSON files correctly using
    the TDRMesh class.
Sample 04 - Displays the same cube as Sample 03, but loads the cube via the
    JSON mesh file.

Renderer
--------
Sample 03 - Renders a cube to the screen.  The vertices and UV data is hard-
    coded into the class code.
