    <h1>TDRMesh Specification</h1>
    <h2>Root Object</h2>
    <p>Every TDRMesh JSON file is an object.  When you open the file, the 
    first thing you should see is an opening curly brace.  Everything
    contained within those two braces are part of the same TDRMesh object.</p>
    <h2>Sub-Objects</h2>
    <p>From the root object, you will have other objects identifed by strings.
    As an example, you may see:
<pre>
{
    "example_object": {
        ...
    },
    ...,
    ...,
}
</pre>
    which would identify that sub-object by the name "example_object".
    That mesh object can contain whatever data is relevant to that structure.
    However, all data must be provided with a valid identifer.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Textures: Paths of where to find textures, and what type of format
        that the texture is stored as.</li>
      <li>Shaders: Paths that point to where to find various shaders used for
        rendering the object.</li>
      <li>Primitives: Typically raw float data associated with vertex or
        UV data, as an example.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Textures</h3>
    <p>Not a texture, but a texture path where the engine knows to look for
    the texture.  Each texture is an array that tells you the type of texture
    and the path to the texture:</p>
<pre>["DDS", "texture.dds"]</pre>
    <p>Tells you that the path is "texture.dds", and the format is "DDS", which
    is a DirectDrawSurface.  At this point, the supported texture formats
    are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DirectDrawSurface (DDS)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Shaders</h3>
    <p>Shaders, much like textures, aren't actually contained withint the
    TDRMesh json file.  It's simply a path.  You specify the type and the path
    and the TDRMesh loader will know what to do.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fragment Shaders: fshader</li>
      <li>Geometry Shaders: gshader</li>
      <li>Vertex Shaders: vshader</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As an example, this tells you that the shader you want to load is a
    Vertex shader, and is called "some_shader.vs":</p>
<pre>
    vshader = 'some_shader.vs'
</pre>
    <h3>Primitives</h3>
