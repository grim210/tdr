    <h1>TDRMesh Specification</h1>
    <h2>Root Object</h2>
    <p>Every TDRMesh JSON file is an object.  When you open the file, the 
    first thing you should see is an opening curly brace.  Everything
    contained within those two braces are part of the same TDRMesh object.</p>
    <h2>Sub-Objects</h2>
    <p>From the root object, you will have other objects identifed by strings.
    As an example, you may see:
<pre>
{
    "example_object": {
        ...
    },
    ...,
    ...,
}
</pre>
    which would identify that sub-object by the name "example_object".
    That mesh object can contain whatever data is relevant to that structure.
    However, all data must be provided with a valid identifer.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Textures: Paths of where to find textures, and what type of format
        that the texture is stored as.</li>
      <li>Shaders: Paths that point to where to find various shaders used for
        rendering the object.</li>
      <li>Primitives: Typically raw float data associated with vertex or
        UV data, as an example.</li>
    </ul>
